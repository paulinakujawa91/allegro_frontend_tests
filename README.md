# allegro_frontend_tests
Automation tests for allegro's frontend written in python on selenium.

Only for features 'log in' and 'log out' I tested correctly before ban from allegro sandbox. I created feature for modification 'personal data' in account tab also. Unfortunately I can't tested it after ban the website, so this feature might have a mistakes.
